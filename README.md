# CCPU-CC

An optimizing compiler targeting [my custom discrete logic computer](https://github.com/imihajlow/ccpu/).

The compiler produces assembly files. You will need the assembler and the linker from [the original repository](https://github.com/imihajlow/ccpu/).

The C standard library is located in [its own repository](https://github.com/imihajlow/ccpu-libc/).
